<!--How do we create actually a form in html. So to create a form in html we have a tag called as form which has two attributes in which the first one is action attributes which actually tells us that where the from has actually been submitted but on the other hand we have the method attributes which actually tells us how the form can be submitted.Form can be submitted either by using POST method or GET method.-->
